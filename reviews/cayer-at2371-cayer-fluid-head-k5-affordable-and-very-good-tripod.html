Which is a very heavy camera or those rigs with external batteries, screens and so on.</p> <p data-v-6dff3498>This is a real incredibly high quality looking tripod, it’s made from aluminium alloy materials, it’s weight (eiiight) is about 3 kilos. with the center column raised the max height is about 72 inches or 1.8 meters, or 1.5 meters without that. Folded is about 0.8 meters.</p> <p data-v-6dff3498>The tripod got these ball heads down on the feet, so these can actually bend into basically any direction, or that sort of thing based on what you need,  and then of course they are extendable, it got three layers of extension that allows you to set up this high as 72 inches which is pretty neat.</p> <p data-v-6dff3498>Cayer is using the twist locking system to make, it makes easier and quicker to operate.</p> <div class="amz-buy-product article" data-v-2540bf11><h6 data-v-2540bf11>Cayer AT2371 is available to buy here:</h6> <iframe marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ac&amp;ref=qf_sp_asin_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=brickart00-20&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=B0784CWMP4&amp;asins=B0784CWMP4&amp;linkId=3a9246f7fd8f643631c8e1caf503ea95&amp;show_border=false&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=false&amp;price_color=333333&amp;title_color=0066c0&amp;bg_color=ffffff" style="width:120px;height:240px;" data-v-2540bf11></iframe></div> <p data-v-6dff3498>The legs besides the available extension can also be inclined by 3 levels.  The pull-out type adjuster system. Those 3 levels plus the reversible center column, that can be placed from the bottom up, allows low angle, micro shooting and very good shoots close to the ground. At the bottom of the center column, you also have a hook to hang weight if you need it.</p> <p data-v-6dff3498>The rubber feet can be easily changed to stainless steel spike feet according to the different terrains you want to use the tripod.</p> <p data-v-6dff3498>So the tripod itself sets up pretty easy, all you do is pull the legs aport and then it’s going to rest down on the ground. We can actually go ahead and unscrew to extend the height of the tripod.</p> <p data-v-6dff3498>As you can see the tripod is looking quite nice. You have a nice and solid construction and then the feet they actually lay down on the ground really really well to allow this tripod to be very very stable.</p> <p data-v-6dff3498>Now lets look at the head, the cayer  k5 professional fluid head, was one of the things that caused me to purchase this tripod. The head that’s on the tripod is a dual fluid motion meaning it’s got a fluid drag on both the rotation of the tripod head as well as it’s going to have drag on the tilt of the tripod head.</p> <p data-v-6dff3498>That’s going to allow for really really smooth camera motions. The pitching angle is between  plus 90 degrees until - 70 degrees.</p> <p data-v-6dff3498>As you can see on the side we have a lock which looks the fluid head from being able to work as well as for the rotation. It comes with a nice little level so that you would be able to make sure that the camera head is level.</p> <div class="amz-pub article" data-v-e25f8f56><h6 data-v-e25f8f56>Recommended products</h6> <div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aedda568-6094-4174-9a16-ee17c460ac2b" data-v-e25f8f56></div></div> <h2 id="fluid-head" data-v-6dff3498><a href="#fluid-head" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor" data-v-6dff3498>#</a> Fluid Head</h2> <p data-v-6dff3498>On this review we are taking a look at this new video tripod from Cayer, it’s from the monotube series and it’s called the CT3470,  It’s a 72 inch or 1.8 meters tripod, it’s super sturdy and it’s designed to be able to carry just over 8 kilos.
